##This is a practice project for me to jump into and learn

####Wish to learn the recursion and backtracking 

#####While I came up a idea before using the recursion, to optimalizaing the data, Wish I could coding it out in my version 2.0 to optimalizing the soduku sdolver

#####In the last version, I can use opencv api to read any sudoku from photos and find a wayout for the sudoku


#The first post question about the combination for 9x9 sudoku which is possible, https://groups.google.com/g/rec.puzzles/c/A7pi7S12oFI
# The combination of possible sudoku is NOT 9!*8!*7!*6!*5!*4!*3!*2! = 7,34 * 10^21
# Using the monte Carlo estimation is == 6.67 * 10^21
