##This is a practice project for me to jump into and learn

####Wish to learn the recursion and backtracking 

#####While I came up a idea before using the recursion, to optimalizaing the data, Wish I could coding it out in my version 2.0 to optimalizing the soduku sdolver

#####In the last version, I can use opencv api to read any sudoku from photos and find a wayout for the sudoku
